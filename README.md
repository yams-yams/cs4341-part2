# CS 4341 Digital Logic Project Part 2

Can be compiled on the command line using "make" (given that iVerilog is installed).

Current issues are: 
Bits are not all flipped for subtraction, 
Addition overflow needs to be put in the 33rd most significant bit, 
Not all 64 bits of output are produced? or printed each time,  
Logic gates are not yet implemented.
